Next, we will be working on producing LLM chains. A RAG application will feature multiple
steps of distinct LLM operations, for which they may be provided access to different prompts
and resources, each tailored to a specific task. Every one of those operations may be labelled 
as their own 'chain'. For now, let's create some LLM chains that are simply
built on a basic prompt, and make functions that will return the message from a chat with a specific 
chain.
